  - Primary emotion (frustrated, confused, neutral, positive)
  - Urgency level (low, medium, high)
  - Customer satisfaction score (1-10)

### 3. Context-Aware Responses
- Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to:
  - Retrieve relevant documents based on the query
  - Generate contextually appropriate responses
  - Maintain conversation coherence

### 4. Modern Web Interface
- Clean and intuitive chat interface built with **React**
- Real-time message updates
- Loading indicators for better UX

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Parallax316/Agentic-AI-Customer-Support.git
    cd agentic-ai-support
    ```

2.  **Set up Backend:**
    - Create and activate virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      # Windows
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      # Linux/Mac
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - Install backend dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Run the backend server:
      ```bash
      uvicorn main:app --reload
      ```
      The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Set up Frontend (React):**
    
      
    - Install frontend dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install 
      # or yarn install
      ```
    - Start the React development server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      # or yarn start
      ```
      The frontend application will likely open automatically in your browser, often at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Access the application:**
    - Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

Overview:
This document provides a detailed explanation of our refund process, designed to ensure transparency and efficiency for our customers. Whether you are requesting a refund due to a defective product, an incorrect order, or a cancellation, the following guidelines will help you understand what to expect throughout the process.

Step 1: Refund Request Initiation:
- To begin the refund process, contact our Customer Support Team via our online portal, phone, or email.
- Provide your order number, a detailed explanation of your request, and any supporting documentation (such as photos or receipts) that justify the refund.
- Our support team will review your request and provide you with a Refund Authorization Number (RAN) if your request meets the necessary criteria.

Step 2: Return or Verification of Product:
- Depending on the nature of your refund, you may be required to return the product. If so, our team will provide detailed instructions on how to securely package and ship the item back to us.
- In cases where a return is not necessary (such as billing errors or subscription issues), our team will verify the transaction details through our internal systems.
- It is crucial to follow the instructions provided during this step to avoid delays in processing your refund.

Step 3: Processing the Refund:

- Refunds are typically processed within 7-10 business days, although processing times may vary during peak periods.
- The refunded amount will be credited to the original payment method used during the purchase. In cases where an alternative refund method is preferred, please inform our support team in advance.

Step 4: Confirmation and Follow-Up:
- After your refund is processed, you will receive a confirmation email with the details of the transaction, including the refunded amount and the date of processing.
- If you do not receive a confirmation or if you have any questions regarding your refund, please do not hesitate to contact our Customer Service Team.
- Our team will provide updates and, if necessary, escalate the issue to ensure a satisfactory resolution.

Additional Considerations:
